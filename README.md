Arduino Due VGA library - NTSC branch

This is an experimental branch of the VGA library which gives NTSC colour output.
You will need an R-2R DAC on pins 34-41 (34 LSB,41 MSB) and probably a buffer
amplifier after that.

To install: move the VGA directory into your Arduino libraries directory, then (re)start the Arduino IDE.
